Poor little Oompa Loompa...
Trump couldn't explain why Hillary is a "bigot" and made himself look really foolish. Anderson even had to tell him the definition of the word.
Mark Cuban just hit Trump where it hurts him the most....his ego about being a billionaire.
Jeb didn't call them a basket of deplorables, but he came damn close.
And the room went wild.
War is not a game. THIS, what he said at this rally, is why he’s wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military.
This is hilariously sad.
Of all the stupid things...

John Kasich doesn’t give a sh*t about Priebus’ pathetic threats.

Donald Trump just gets more dangerous every day.

These are the people who are going to be voting in November for Donald Trump.

Even Fox News is embarrassed by Sean Hannity's bromance with Trump.

A Trump campaign official has a creepy vision of the future where people “bow down” to the candidate.
But he’s not racist, he swears!
You know all those threads that just show strings of anti-Hillary memes? Well, they came from one place.
This ad is so powerful.
Donald Trump thinks African-Americans are worse off now than they have ever been, and President Obama just took him to the woodshed for it.
If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn.
If Republicans and Donald Trump really care about our military veterans, they will tell this douchebag to shut the hell up.
And they wonder why we do not trust the police.
Fox News, the Pope is talking to you.
Eric Trump tried to spin a tale on Fox News about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that Donald Trump started out as a millionaire.
No wonder the Republicans tried to stop it!
Now the Trump campaign is denying he’s an adviser, after months of confirming that he was indeed an adviser.
The epidemic of black men being killed at the hands of police officers in America has not gone unnoticed on the international stage.
How this officer can even stand to look at himself in the mirror now is beyond us.

Trump is completely unfit for pretty much everything.
Are they serious?
The only thing this accomplished was proving how sexist Trump is.
Fox News ACTUALLY reported on a touching letter from a New York boy to the President asking if a Syrian refugee can live with him. You can pretty well guess what happened in the comments.
Get ready to see a super awkward interview!
Journalism is dead.

This is so dumb, it's kinda funny.
Is this coward really the one half the country wants to be president?

She tore Trump to pieces in front of millions of people, and the Trump camp's lies and excuses aren't going to hide that fact.

Hillary's Response VS Trump's Response... what do you think?
New York bomb Suspect SUED Police!
It's Worse Than A Third Barack Obama Term!!
Mouths Drop In Total Disbelief
Whoa... longtime Clinton crony and current head of the DNC, Donna Brazile, just accidentally revealed what happened to Hillary as she got into the van on that infamous day. As far as I can tell, no one exposed this until just now. The Clintons have to be FURIOUS with Brazile for saying this. I know I would be...
Now THAT’S bad...
Didn’t think the Clinton Foundation could get any worse? Not so fast.
You've gotta see this!
Do you think he did it?

Do you live in Arizona? Have you ever changed a baby's diaper? You're a felon. FYI.
Words fail me bad right now...
This spells DOOM for our children!
Barack Hussein Obama just went before the United Nations General Assembly and did the unthinkable. No wonder after all this time some people still say he's an Islamist sympathizer. We need @Donald J. Trump more than ever...
If this is what Hillary's fans look like at her rallies, it's no wonder she's getting her clock cleaned by @Donald J. Trump. We love it when a @Fox News reporter has a camera in the right place at the right time!
Do you think the government is doing enough to stop terrorism?
Dangerous!

I can't stand this woman already... but this? This is just MADNESS!
This should terrify Americans into taking responsibility for the future of their country... but will it?

Tolerance and respect, y'all...
THIS is what a world leader looks like!
It's a one way street for these cowards...
People are talking. Very chilling to watch...
First he was totally innocent. Next he was a good guy not hurting anybody. Now the cops have found something a whole lot scarier than a gun in his car, and it could have hurt who knows how many people. The media will hate this and BLM will NEVER acknowledge it because it's so damning to their narrative.
The fiancee of Ambassador Chris Stevens, one of the men killed in the Benghazi attacks, just released a book of her own. In it, she leveled a DEVASTATING accusation at Hillary Clinton. Ouch. This is not good news for Team Hillary.

Westboro Baptist Church decided to protest this Marine's funeral. When word of this leaked out, a group of unexpected guests decided to show up and teach them a lesson.
This state passed a law making every parent a sex offender for changing their baby's diaper.
Exactly one person was offended by this 4-year-old's headstone. One. That was enough, though. Here's headstone. Decide for yourselves if it should've stayed up.
Where is Obama?
It's time for a good story to be shared. Mainstream media won't do it, so we will.
This is an eye opener. Very sad.
Why does he need an excuse to run his own country?
There are no answers in DC, but there are right here. RESPECT.
This is INSANITY!

Hillary knows how to pick 'em...this is sickening.
Hillary just got disastrous bad news from the presidential debate committee. Not only is this a killer for her, it's going to give Donald J. Trump a huge psychological advantage.
Interesting... Thoughts?
Entitled Hillary just demanded that she be given special equipment for the first presidential debate. But the debate committee wasn't about to let her pull a fast one. They smacked her demand down, and what they're making her do now is absolutely humiliating.
Was this the right move?
Good for her!
Go Ditka! We need more people telling it like it is!
This cop was in the middle of arresting a suspect when he suddenly spat on her. She initially brushed it off as just part of the job. It wasn't until she found out she was dying that she learned what was in that suspect's spit.
A judge took one look at what this lawyer had pinned onto her shirt and told her without hesitation: You're going to jail. Do you think the lawyer got what she deserved? Or did the judge go too far?
A guy showed up at this pregnant woman's door and attempted to rape her. Then another. Then another. One ended up beating her pretty badly. She turned to the police, unable to figure out why this was happening. It didn't the police long to figure out what was going on.
When did America Fall So Far?!
Are you FLIPP'IN kidding?!
They want cop free communities, what do you say?
Clinton had affairs with “thousands of women.”
Oh no... not again.
Listen up! Common sense advice to all Americans.
A very presidential move.
Gotcha! Soros caught once again.
Guess how many of them used guns to commit their crimes? A lot less than liberals would guess...

YES! You're going to love this announcement.
This makes me sick.
There are no answers in DC anymore, just corruption.
Classic Clinton cheat...
HUGE!
Oh no.. Our hearts go out to everyone impacted by this great loss.
COME ON! This is getting stupid! The woman is BAD NEWS!
...and in California of ALL places!
LOL! The tables are turning!
A reporter managed to find an unsuspecting Hillary trying to get down some stairs to the sidewalk below. Thankfully the reporter's camera was rolling, and look what it caught her hiding...

Do you agree with Arnold Palmer or Colin Kaepernick?
Do you think Jim Carrey bares some responsibility for her suicide after giving her STDs?
She Offended The Very People She Hoped Would Vote For Her!
BORROWS: "Hold Her Down!"
Brandon Marshall of the Denver Broncos decided to join Colin Kaepernick's NFL protest. He figured there wouldn't be any consequences. Today, he got some bad news.

This is why people love dogs!
Do you think Black Lives Matter is Unamerican?

Powerful...
BREAKING I can't believe this... This is the @Tony Stewart people need to see.

@Paul Ryan, whom conservatives have doubted for months now, made a bombshell announcement right after the 1st presidential debate. Even Republicans who liked Ryan couldn't have seen this coming...
SHE CHEATED!

If you wondered what would have happened if 'Clock Boy' was white...now you'll know.
The TRUTH comes out!
If your own government won't protect you...
With third party candidates included. Just EMBARRASSING...
Did you see this coming?
What is that?
What's going on in our society when support for cops just doing their jobs is called racist?
Do you think it's "racist" to insult someone who hates America like Colin Kaepernick?
I agreed with what he had to say
Why don't stories like this ever seem to get out there?
Do you think liberalism has hurt black Americans by "helping" them?
Important reminder.
GENIUS.
Another nail in the coffin.
Vive la France!
His hands were up the entire time. (TRIGGER WARNING)
He could've killed him.
Wow.
